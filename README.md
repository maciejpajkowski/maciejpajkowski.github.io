# portfolio
My personal website, which allows easy access to all my public repositories. It also sheds some light on my journey as a terrible software developer. 

### Technologies used:
- React.js
- Next.js
- Styled Components
- GraphQL

### Comments:
I was thinking about building my own website from scratch for quite a while, but always thought that I could build something more ambitious. 
Something with fancy CSS styling, decent design pattern and, most importantly, actual data manipulation - preferably getting that data from a certain API. 
Also, not all front-end developers have their personal websites, so apparently this is not a necessity on today's job market.

This led me to believe that perhaps I could focus on something different. But I had no interesting ideas at the time, so, eventually, I settled with my personal website project.

I built it using React.js, Next.js and styled-components. Since this was supposed to be my portfolio, I wanted it to be a display case for all my public projects.
Naturally, I could just hardcode them one by one, but... well, that's not very cost effective, is it?
So I went straight into GitHub's public REST API and got to work, but quickly realized that it doesn't support social preview images, which were vital to my project.
The only way I could access them was through GitHub's GraphQL API, which I didn't know back then. But I learned it. I used it. It works.

The website also has a more classic design compared to today's ones. 
It's also fully responsive (which still needs a few tweaks here and there, but should be perfectly accessible from (hopefully) anywhere).
